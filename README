Introduction
------------

Cardoon is a circuit simulator program being developed using
Python. The design was originally inspired from several ideas in
fREEDA (http://www.freeda.org/) and carrot
(http://vision.lakeheadu.ca/research.html), plus some improvements
that take advantage of the flexibility in Python. The main
documentation page for this project can be found at:

One of the main goals of this project is to obtain a program which is
easy to modify and test to experiment new simulation
algorithms/models. A secondary objective is to add features and make
the program efficient enough to be useful for general use, if
possible.

At this time only a few models are implemented, but some of them are
already more complete than the equivalents in freeda and carrot (such
as MOS EKV 2.6 and the BJT model). State-variable nonlinear device
modeling (in the fREEDA sense) is supported. Currently a
state-variable PN junction model is included. This junction is used to
implement a diode (svdiode) and a bipolar transistor device
(svbjt). Regular voltage controlled models for the diode and BJT are
also available.  Electro-thermal models are automatically generated
from electrical models.  Nonlinear models use automatic
differentiation for jacobian calculation. In addition, automatic
differentiation can also be used to calculate sensitivities.

So far there is no real analysis implemented, except a simple
nonlinear device test routine. The immediate plan is implement basic
DC/AC/Transient(/noise?) analyses to finish testing the model library
and study the performance and explore the performance that can be
achieved.

Cardoon is being developed with Python 2.6 on Debian Squeeze, but it
should work OK with Python 2.7 under other operating systems.

Comments are welcome!
