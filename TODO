Action Plan (TODO file)
-----------------------

#. Add automatic test suite

#. Add support for convolution of freq-defined elements

Other tasks to be done at some time:

* Consider changing saveOP interface (return value?) for nonlinear devices

* Add netlist variable sweep in DC analysis

* Keep testing existing code with more circuits

* Improve convergence control in Newton method

* Implement extrinsic model for MOS trasistors using an approach
  similar to the BJT implementation.

* Add "+" notation for multiple lines in parser 

* Investigate problem with PyTrilinos library: produces segmentation
  fault.
