Action Plan (TODO file)
-----------------------

Short-term goals:

  #. Add automatic test suite
  
  #. Add support for convolution of freq-defined elements and implement
     time delay support in transient analysis
  
  #. Finish implementation of nodal analysis of independent subcircuits

Longer term goals and other tasks to be done at some time:

  * Classify device catalog by device type / improve device library
    organization
  
  * Consider changing saveOP interface (return value?) for nonlinear devices
  
  * Add netlist variable sweep in DC analysis
  
  * Implement time-step control in transient analysis

  * Implement Harmonic Balance analysis

  * Implement extrinsic model for MOS trasistors using an approach
    similar to the BJT implementation.
  
  * Add "+" notation for multiple lines in parser 
  
  * Optimize nodal implementation: 

    - Investigate problem with PyTrilinos library that produces
      segmentation fault

    - Try scikits.umfpack instead of pysparse

    - Optimize matrix filling process
