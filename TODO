Development Plan (TODO file)
----------------------------

Short-term goals:

  #. Update documentation to describe treatment of time-delayed
     control voltages. Add support for time-delayed control voltages
     in AC analysis

  #. Add support for convolution of freq-defined elements 
  
  #. Finish implementation of nodal analysis of independent subcircuits

Longer term goals and other tasks to be done at some time:

  * Convert into Python library with easy-to-use setup script

  * Consider changing saveOP interface (return value?) for nonlinear devices
  
  * Add netlist variable sweep in DC analysis
  
  * Implement time-step control in transient analysis

  * Implement Harmonic Balance analysis (or equivalent)

  * Implement extrinsic model for MOS trasistors using an approach
    similar to the BJT implementation.
  
  * Add "+" notation for multiple lines in parser 
  
  * Implement sparse-matrix-based AC analysis
